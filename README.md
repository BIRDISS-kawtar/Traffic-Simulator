# Traffic-Simulator
A desktop application for road traffic simulation mainly based on two concepts : multithreading and OOP.
Focusing on two types of roads it enables to:
- Define a duration of a simulation and start it
- Pause the simulation 
- Stop the simulation 
- Add cars
- Simulate an accident 
- Sum up with some statistics (average speed,average waiting time in case of traffic jam and the size of the generated sample) at the end of the simulation
